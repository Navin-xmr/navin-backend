# Navin Backend

**Navin** is a blockchain-powered logistics platform that improves supply chain visibility for enterprises through tokenized shipments, immutable milestone tracking, and automated settlements.
By creating a zero-trust interface between logistics providers and their clients, Navin aims to ensure both parties access identical real-time data — removing information asymmetry and enabling seamless, dispute-free operations.

The backend service powers the off-chain layer of the platform, handling API logic, data aggregation, and integration with Soroban smart contracts.
